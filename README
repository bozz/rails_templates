TODO: 
======

- instead of copying local generators, need to get them from git (see auth.rb::9)

- if rspec is used, then factory_girl will also be used. In this case factory_girl must still be required and the factory definitions initialized in spec/spec_helper.rb:

		require 'factory_girl'
		Factory.find_definitions
